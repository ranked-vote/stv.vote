    Instant-runoff elections
  </a>
  produce a lot of data about voter preferences. Typically, this information is
  made available by election boards in specialized file formats and requires
  processing to interpret. The purpose of ranked.vote is to increase transparency into these
  elections by creating detailed and intuitive reports about them.
</p>

<p>
  All reports are generated from the raw ballot data, rather than using the
  official tabulation. As a result, the reports also serve as an independent
  tabulation of the results that can be reproduced using published source code.
</p>

<h2>Featured Elections</h2>

<p>
  We feature elections where the ranked-choice voting process was meaningful—specifically,
  races that required three or more rounds of tabulation. Elections decided in one or two
  rounds are excluded because they represent cases where a candidate won with a clear
  majority from the start, making the instant-runoff mechanism less relevant. By focusing
  on elections with multiple rounds of elimination and vote transfers, we highlight cases
  where ranked-choice voting had a substantial impact on determining the winner.
