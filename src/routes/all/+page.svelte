      <h1>stv.vote</h1>:
      all elections.
    </div>
    <p>
      This page shows all STV elections in the database, including
      those with 2 or fewer candidates that are filtered from the
      <a href="/">main page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some elections are highlighted when they exhibit
      interesting characteristics: the STV winner differs from the Condorcet
      winner (the candidate who would beat all others in head-to-head matchups),
      there is a Condorcet cycle (no single candidate beats all others), or
      exhausted ballots outnumbering the winner's votes.
    </p>

    <p>
      stv.vote was created by
      <a href="https://paulbutler.org">Paul Butler</a> and
      <a href="https://felixsargent.com">Felix Sargent</a>.
      It is non-partisan and has received no outside funding.
    </p>

    <p>If you enjoy alternate voting systems, you may also enjoy
      <a href="https://approval.vote">approval.vote</a>,
      which is a similar project for approval voting elections.
