      <h1>ranked.vote</h1>:
      all elections.
    </div>
    <p>
      This page shows all ranked-choice elections in the database, including
      those with 2 or fewer candidates that are filtered from the
      <a href="/">main page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some elections are highlighted with a warning badge when the RCV winner
      differs from the Condorcet winner—the candidate who would beat all others
      in head-to-head matchups. These cases reveal interesting dynamics in voter
      preferences and can indicate strategic voting or complex preference patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
      ranked.vote was created by
      <a href="https://paulbutler.org">Paul Butler</a> and
      <a href="https://felixsargent.com">Felix Sargent</a>.
      It is non-partisan and has received no outside funding.
    </p>

    <p>If you enjoy alternate voting systems, you may also enjoy
      <a href="https://approval.vote">approval.vote</a>,
      which is a similar project for approval voting elections.
