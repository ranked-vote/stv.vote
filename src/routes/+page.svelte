      <h1>rcv.report</h1>:
      detailed reports on ranked-choice elections.
    </div>
    <p>
      Ranked-choice elections produce more data on voter preferences than
      pick-one elections. <strong>rcv.report</strong> runs analysis on the
      ballot-level data and publishes reports on each election.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some elections are highlighted with a warning badge when the RCV winner
      differs from the Condorcet winner—the candidate who would beat all others
      in head-to-head matchups. These cases reveal interesting dynamics in voter
      preferences and can indicate strategic voting or complex preference patterns.
